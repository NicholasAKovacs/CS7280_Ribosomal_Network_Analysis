# CS7280_Ribosomal_Network_Analysis

This is the final project for the course CS 7280 at Georgia Tech. This work is directly related to my PhD thesis and will be incorporated into it. I will continue developing this project, but in a private repo until the work gets published.

Here is the final result for the class project (takes ~ a minute to load):
